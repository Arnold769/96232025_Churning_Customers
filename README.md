# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview

This project is aimed at predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The model has been trained to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on certain features such as tenure, monthly charges, and total charges. The prediction is binary, indicating whether a customer is likely to churn ("Churn") or not ("No Churn").

## Project Structure

- **`app.py`**: The main Streamlit application file that takes user input, preprocesses it, and makes predictions using the trained model.
- **`saved_model.h5`**: The saved Keras model file that is loaded in the application for making predictions.
- **`scaler.pkl`**: The serialized scaler file used to preprocess user input data.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the required Python packages for running the application.
